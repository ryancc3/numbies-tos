            <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>

                <li>Your use or inability to use the App</li>
                <li>Any unauthorized access to or use of your device</li>
                <li>Any bugs, viruses, or other harmful code that may be transmitted to or through the App</li>
                <li>Any errors or omissions in any content or data loss of any kind incurred</li>
                <li>Your failure to back up your data</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. No Warranty of Accuracy</h2>

                While we strive to provide accurate calculations and functionality, we make no guarantees about the accuracy of tree counts, earnings calculations, statistics, or any other computations performed by the App. You should verify all important calculations independently.
            </p>

            <h2>9. Updates and Modifications</h2>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the App at any time without notice. We may also update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document when changes are made.
            </p>

            <h2>10. No Professional Advice</h2>
            <p>
                The App is a tool for tracking and organizing tree planting data. It does not provide professional, legal, financial, or operational advice. Any decisions you make based on data from the App are your own responsibility.
            </p>

            <h2>11. Termination</h2>
            <p>
                You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it from your device. Please note that uninstalling the App will delete all locally stored data unless you have created a backup using the App's backup functionality.
            </p>

            <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>
                These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which you reside, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

            <h2>14. Severability</h2>
            <p>
                If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect.
            </p>

            <h2>15. Entire Agreement</h2>
            <p>
                These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Numbies regarding the use of the App and supersede any prior agreements or understandings.
